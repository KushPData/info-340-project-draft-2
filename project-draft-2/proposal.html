        <h2>Problem Description</h2>

        <p>
            We are interested in how we can manage the numerous events that occur at the University of Washington (UW) everyday. As students, we have first hand experience with the current methods that can cause difficulty in keeping track of these events, but this also ignites our passion to work in this domain. It is known that students have difficulty getting involved on campus as they might not be aware of the opportunities provided or they do not know where to start. This is a particular problem at our school due to its size, number of students, and outside connections. With so many sports, residential life, Registered Student Organizations (RSOs), and other events at UW, it can be difficult to organize them in a single space. Each of these entities have their own way of communicating about its events, making it extremely hard to integrate the data in a unified format.   
        </p>

        <p>
            There is a <a href="https://www.washington.edu/calendar/">campus calendar</a> on UW’s website which provides a list of activities occurring on campus or online everyday; you can add these events to your own personal calendar(s). Unfortunately, the site is very unintuitive, which would not entice students. Also, there’s no way to filter these events. Interspersed between the events are educational activities, such as office hours and departmental events. Without a filter, they clutter up the calendar. Even worse, all of these events are UW sanctioned with no room for RSOs. We want to see how we can better assist students in planning ahead for these events so they can take advantage of the opportunities provided.

        <h2>Proposed Application</h2>

        <p>
            The users of this catalog are students and employees at UW, although it would primarily be marketed towards students since they would be more likely to participate in these events. This site would especially benefit first year students who are new to campus and don’t know much about any events they can participate in. It’s a great way for them to get engaged in UW campus life. For minoritized groups, this site can help them engage with people of similar identities. Someone could look for events that cater to their identities on this site. For example, someone of Asian descent might try to find events by Asian RSOs. They’ll find a myriad of Asian-centered events, including a performance by <a href="https://www.taikokai.com/">UW Taiko Kai</a>, the Japanese drumming RSO.
        </p>

        <p>
            The "UW Events Catalog" web-based application that is being considered intends to make it easier for UW students and employees to remain updated and to take part in a variety of events on campus.
        </p>

        <p>
            Users will be able to:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Add events to their calendars</li>
            <li>Participate in the review feature that includes rating an event with a comment describing the reason for their rating</li>
            <li>Search for and filter events according to the price, type, and organization
            </li>
            <li>RSOs may submit their events through the app building an extensive database
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The app offers an easy method for users to find and take part in campus events, and by presenting a variety of instances, it hopes to encourage diversity and inclusion. Users may easily locate and take part in the activities they are interested in thanks to the user-friendly functions, which include search, filtering process, and feedback. Moreover, they will be able to view information like the date, time, location, entry fee (if applicable), and description of the events which will help them plan their time and resources accordingly. Additionally, they will also be able to see reviews from other students who might have attended an event previously, helping them decide if they want to attend an event or not.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our app will benefit students and employees at UW by providing an extensive catalogue of events on campus so that they do not have to go to different web pages and locations to gain this information. Moreover, the ability to filter events according to one’s interests will help students easily find communities they are interested in. This will specifically benefit first year students who are looking to connect with others who have similar interests, forming communities they will cherish for their time at UW as well as the rest of their lives.
